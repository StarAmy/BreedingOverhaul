Breeding Overhaul is a Stardew Valley mod that aims to revamp the vanilla breeding system when used in conjunction with Animal Husbandry Mod (formerly ButcherMod) and Better Farm Animal Variety. It consists of the following sections:

1. Breeding Overhaul, the main project code. It makes the following changes to the base game / Animal Husbandry Mod behavior:

        Disables normal incubator function, requiring the correct type of 'fertilized' egg instead (the item required for each type of animal can be manually set/reconfigured in the config file 'Incubator Data').
        
        Disables normal pregnancy/insemination function, requiring the correct type of 'DNA' in the insemination syringe instead (the item required for each type of animal can be manually set/reconfigured in the config file 'Pregnancy Data').
    
2. [BFAV] Vanilla Males adds male variants to every category of vanilla livestock via Better Farm Animal Variety. Males drop manure as a common drop, and a species-specific item as a rare drop. 
        
        Male Cow = Manure, Cow Horn
        
        Male Goat = Manure, Goat Horn
        
        Male Sheep = Manure, Sheep Horn
        
        Male Pig = Manure, Pig Tusk
        
        Male Chicken = Manure, Chicken Feather
        
        Male Duck = Manure, Duck Feather (the same item as in vanilla)
        
        Male Rabbit = Manure, Rabbit Foot (the same item as in vanilla)
        
        Male Ostrich = Manure, Ostrich Feather
        
        Male Dinosaur = Manure, Dinosaur Scale

3. [AHM] Vanilla Male Rules adds rules for Animal Husbandry Mod behavior, including number and type of meat drops, for the new male variants. 

        Males drop the same quantity/type of meat and have the same treat preferences as their vanilla/female counterparts.

4. [CP] Vanilla Livestock Tweaks makes some changes to the pre-existing livestock to make them feel more like females and fit in better with this mod, including some configurable texture changes, and 'large egg' variants for several of the poultry types. The production for the 'female' (vanilla) variants is now as follows:
        
        White Cow = Milk, Large Milk
        
        Brown Cow = Milk, Large Milk
        
        Goat = Goat Milk, Large Goat Milk
        
        Sheep = Wool
        
        Pig  = Truffle
        
        White Chicken = White Egg, Large White Egg
        
        Brown Chicken = Brown Egg, Large Brown Egg
        
        Blue Chicken = Blue Egg, Large Blue Egg
        
        Void Chicken = Void Egg, Large Void Egg
        
        Golden Chicken = Golden Egg, Large Golden Egg
        
        Duck = Duck Egg, Large Duck Egg
        
        Rabbit = Rabbit Foot
        
        Ostrich = Ostrich Egg, Large Ostrich Egg
        
        Dinosaur = Dinosaur Egg
        
5. [JA] Breeding Overhaul Objects adds all the new objects dropped by 'male' and 'female' variants, as well as the DNA and fertilized eggs they can be crafted or processed into.
        
        Manure 
        
        Cow Horn, Goat Horn, Sheep Horn, Pig Tusk, Chicken Feather, Ostrich Feather, and Dinosaur Scale 
        
        Cow DNA, Goat DNA, Sheep DNA, Pig DNA, Chicken DNA, Duck DNA, Rabbit DNA, Ostrich DNA, and Dinosaur DNA
        
        Blue Egg, Large Blue Egg, Large Duck Egg, Large Golden Egg, Large Void Egg, and Large Ostrich Egg
        
        Fertilized White Egg, Fertilized Brown Egg, Fertilized Blue Egg, Fertilized Void Egg, Fertilized Golden Egg, Fertilized Duck Egg, and Fertilized Ostrich Egg
        
        Blue Mayonnaise, Golden Mayonnaise, Ostrich Mayonnaise
        
6. [PFM] Breeding Overhaul Object Rules adds processing rules for all the new objects. 

    The recycling machine now produces:
       
       Manure = Quality Fertilizer
        
        Cow Horn = Cow DNA
        
        Goat Horn = Goat DNA
        
        Sheep Horn = Sheep DNA
        
        Pig Tusk = Pig DNA
        
        Chicken Feather = Chicken DNA
        
        Duck Feather = Duck DNA
        
        Rabbit Foot = Rabbit DNA
        
        Ostrich Feather = Ostrich DNA
        
        Dinosaur Scale = Dinosaur DNA
        
     The mayonnaise machine now produces:
        
        Blue Egg, Large Blue Egg = Blue Mayonnaise
        
        Golden Egg, Large Golden Egg = Golden Mayonnaise
        
        Ostrich Egg, Large Ostrich Egg = Ostrich Mayonnaise
